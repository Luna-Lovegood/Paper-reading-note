# Retrieval of water-leaving radiance and aerosol optical thickness over the oceans with SeaWiFS: a preliminary algorithm
### 本文的目标
Our goal is to refine the CZCS atmospheric-correction
algorithm to utilize the new
spectral bands and the increased sensitivity to improve
the accuracy of the pigment retrieval. A by- product of this atmospheric-correction algorithm is
an estimate of the aerosol optical thickness.
### 大气校正就是需要从如下式子中得到water-leaving reflectance(Pw)
Pt(A) = Pr(X) + Pa(X) + Pra(X) + Pg(X) + tPw(X)
